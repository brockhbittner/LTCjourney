These are my notes that I take on my journey to learn to cloud! Thank you so much to @madebygps and @rishabkumar7 for all your hard work in setting this up. I am so grateful for the chance to work through these phases.


## Day 1:

Getting familiar with GitHub and how it works is difficult, to say the least. I am thankful that I have had at least some experience in the command line from my Google IT Support Specialist certification. Part of the problem was the technical difficulties that I encountered. Here is a description of how I worked through some of these problems:

> First, GitHub Desktop was wanting me to use ATOM as my text editor, which I learned through some research was incompatible as it was sunsetted by Git a couple years back. 

> Then, I discovered VSCode and got that installed. However, the changes I was making were not showing up in GitHub for me to commit and push. After some reasearch I discovered the problem was that autosave was turned off. So in the VSCode settings I turned autosave to "on Focus Change." Now, whenever I click off VSCode to GitHub desktop, it automatically recognizes the changes that I have made. So problem solved! 

> But not so fast! I then went to continue working through Topic 1: Version Control and I copied "git clone https://github.com/rishabkumar7/ltc-labs" into VSCode and received the following error: "xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun" 

> So I did some research on this and found that I needed to install some command line tools. I researched the command to initiate the download and copied it into VSCode: xcode-select --install 

> Viola! 

I was able to read through the [Microsoft document about Markdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/communicate-using-markdown/2-what-is-markdown), which was really helpful. I tried to implement some of it here just to get some familiarity with it. I am going to stop here for now and pick back up later to continue working on Topic 2: Cloud CLI Setup another time. I already have an AWS account, so that gives me a good start on that!
